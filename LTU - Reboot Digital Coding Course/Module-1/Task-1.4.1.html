Reflection

In today's session I learnt that the web development industry is a rewarding, lucrative and creative industry to get into.

I also introduced myself to a class of strangers, this was initially a hard thing for me to do.

Tha part that I enjoyed the most getting to know people across UK who are interested in coding. We had to introduce ourselves at the beginning.

The part that I found hard was speaking out in a class full of strangers.

After the lesson we watched a video about the internet and its terminologies.
